Should do:
    Set position of robot
    Record robot path (based on way-points?)
    Tell robot pose in telemetry
        Mark way-points in Dashboard?
    Preset movements
        Go forward X feet, turn X degrees, go back to last set position, remove position (have telemetry list positions and current position/heading)
